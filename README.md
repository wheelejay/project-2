# Fitness Chasers
 A weight tracking app to help keep you motivated

 ## About the Project

### Why did you make this?
I was in a weight loss competition last year and we were tracking our weights with a glorified excell spredsheet. I wanted to take that concept to the next level with a react app that was fully integrated with a chart that was local to the app.


 ### Struggles

 My biggest struggle starting this project was learning how data bases work, what their relationship was with the front end and how to transger things from the front end, to the server then to the back end into the data tables. 

I wanted to integrate a chart and a date picker because I wanted the app to look clean. Both the chart and the date picker were easy to set up but in order for them to have the utility of being dynamic it took hours to go through documentataion and other resources to find out how to get these features to function how I wanted them to function.

 ## How to Run Fitness Chasers

To run the app put 

```npm run dev```

in the console and you will be able to access the web page and create a user.


 ## Next Steps

 I'd really like to implement the following features:

 **Friends list** - This would allow you to make a community of support amongst your friends that would help every on work towards their goals.

 **Competition Page with Leader Board** - On this project I was able to do a static leaderboard but I never made it dynamic and able to compare other users that were in a group together. I feel like this is the next big step for the project and something that I would like to implent in the future so that I can use this app for personal use.
